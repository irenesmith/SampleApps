# Documents

Documentation samples created by Irene Smith

The documents included here are:

- **modal** - A step-by-step tutorial that shows how to create and display
  a modal dialog box over the web page. The tutorial is in index.html.
- **BeginningWebDevelopment** is a Microsoft Word document that (in this
  repo) disccuses the parts of an HTML page. The articles were written early
  this year as part of a potential book on web development. Thereis also a PDF
  copy of the document.
- **[How to Search](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/How_to/Search)** -
  An article on MDN Web Docs that describes the search capabilities of the
  Firefox JavaScript Debugger. As of July 30, 2020, the page lists me as the
  last to edit it on October 15, 2019.
- [Element: mousedown event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousedown_event)
  is an MDN Web Docs page describing the event handler for the mousedown event.
  The reference was written as part of an initiative to document all
  event handlers.

  The page describes the mousedown event and the accompanying JavaScript example
  uses the mousedown, musemove, and mouseup event handlers to let the reader draw
  using the mouse. To keep the example simple, it only draws. There is no eraser
  and no ability to change the drawing color or the pen thickness.
