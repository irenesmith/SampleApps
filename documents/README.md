# Documents

Documentation samples created by Irene Smith

The documents included here are:

- **modal** - An html page that displays a modal window. The tutorial is
  in index.html.
- **Anatomy_of_a_Web_Page.docx** is a Microsoft Word document that disccuses
  the parts of a web page. It was written as part of a book about web
  development. It is for beginning web developers.
- MDN Web Docs page describing the event handler for the [Element: mousedown
  event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousedown_event).
  The reference was written as part of an initiative to document all
  event handlers.

  The code is JavaScript and the page describes the event handler and then
  shows an example that lets the reader draw using the mouse. To keep the example
  simple, it only draws. There is no eraser and no ability to change the
  drawing color.
