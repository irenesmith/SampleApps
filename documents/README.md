# Documents

Documentation samples created by Irene Smith

The documents included here are:

- **modal** - A step-by-step tutorial that shows how to create and display
  a modal dialog box over the web page. The tutorial is in index.html.
- **Anatomy_of_a_Web_Page.docx** is a Microsoft Word document that disccuses
  the parts of a web page. It was written as part of a book about web
  development. The target audience is beginning web developers.
- [How to Search](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/How_to/Search) -
  Describes the search capabilities of the Firefox JavaScript Debugger. As of July 30, 2020,
  the page lists me as the last to edit it on October 15, 2019.
- MDN Web Docs page describing the event handler for the [Element: mousedown
  event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousedown_event).
  The reference was written as part of an initiative to document all
  event handlers.

  The code is JavaScript and the page describes the event handler and then
  shows an example that lets the reader draw using the mouse. To keep the example
  simple, it only draws. There is no eraser and no ability to change the
  drawing color or the pen thickness.
