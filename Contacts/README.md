# Contacts

Contacts is a work in progress. Created as a project to refresh
my C++ skills which I havne't used in a while. Ulimately, this
application will do simple CRUD functions.

1. **DONE** Created the menu content, display the menu, and get commands
from the user.

2. Define the data layout for contacts and the contact list and
then, using mock data, write code to get and display the list.
