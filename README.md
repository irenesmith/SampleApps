# Sample Applications

This repository contains sample code as well as documentation samples
created by Irene Smith

The contents are as follows:

- **documents** contains sample documentation and links to additional examples
  on MDN Web Docs.
- **snipman** - I created this app back in 2012 to track the tasks and projects
  I was working on when I was at Google. Employees were required to submit a
  list of the tasks they completed during the week. This app allowed me to create
  the file as I was working on it during the week. It helped me to remember what
  I had worked on so I could report it accurately.
- **stuff2do** - A jQuery example that manages a simple To Do list. Tasks
  are stored in local storage rather than in a database just to keep the
  application simple. It was written as a learning exercise.
- **WhatToDo** - A C# Windows Desktop application that also maintains a list
  of tasks. In this case, tasks are stored in a text file.
